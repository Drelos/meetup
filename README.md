# Western Greece Developers Meetup

This repository is used to help us organize the events, collect ideas and discuss issues in a very familiar way.
We also use meetup.com for RSVPs and other announcements:

## Presentations

Did you present during an event? If you want you can share your slides with the
world. Please open a Pull Request which adds the presentation to the appropriate
meetup directory under presentations.

E.g. `presentations/meetup_1/my_presentation.pdf`

If possible use the pdf format for consistency.

## Presentation Proposals

Do you want to present something on the upcoming meetup? Please open a Pull Request
which updates the relevant meetup README file.

E.g. To present on meetup#1, open a PR which adds your presentation to this file:

`meetups/1/README.md`

This way people can comment, ask questions and upvote your presentation.
