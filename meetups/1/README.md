# Meetup #1

Event link: https://www.meetup.com/Western-Greece-Software-Development-Meetup/events/240584653/

## Agenda

The following are topics that will be discussed and some proposals

### Introduction

Present ourselves. Whoever wants can present themselves in anyway they like
(interests, expectations, where they come from, interest in organizing a next
meetup etc). Something like 3 minutes per person should be enough.

### Location

- Criteria for selection
  - At least 2 presentations
  - A venue to host the event
  - On person attending taking responsibility (booking venue  etc)

### Frequency

- Standard (e.g. every 2 months)
- Whenever a place gets 2 presentations for a specific date and at least N
  number of days have passed since the last meetup.
  (first to reach, organizes the event). We will need to create a tool for this.
  (maybe create one in a workshop?)

### Topics

- Come what may (from IoT to Drupal development, bring it on).
- Related to programming only (no descriptive languages, CMS', system administration etc).
- Vote for presentations (Some topics/languages might always win).

### Organizational tools

- Git repository
- Meetup.com
- Mailing list? Google group?

## Presentations

TODO: Do we want any presentations for this first meetup? Might make it a little
more interesting but might be irrelevant unless we first discuss the above.
